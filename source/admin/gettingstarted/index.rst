Known bugs
=============

.. note::

Login for the first time
========================

* Login to to the server with your email and password which is
  probably your email.

Create the first exercise
=========================

* After login , several buttons are visible on the toolbar.

.. image:: toolbar.png

     :width: 600px

* The ``ShowAll`` button toggles the display of unpublished exercises.

* Press the ``ShowAll`` button and now the circle icon to the left is
  now filled in. Below the toolbar, you will now now see a |fa-plus|
  symbol along with ``Exercise name``.

     :align: center
     :width: 100px

* Use your mouse to click on ``Exercise name``.

* Now you can enter title of the new exercise. E.g. ``Kinetic energy of an ideal gas``.

* Hit the ``Return`` key.

The new exercise will now be shown under the toolbar.

     :align: center
     :width: 600px

* Press the camera icon (|fa-camera|) to upload a JPG or PNG file.
  *Use a small file, a few 100Kb at most*.

* In the XML representation, change the value contained in the
  ``<figure>`` tag to be the name of the file you uploaded.

* Press the ``Save`` button on the XML representation panel. You will
  now see a thumbnail of the image along with the exersize.

* In the the XML, you can rename the exercise by changing the contents of the ``<exercisnename>`` tag.

If you are impatient to improvise on the file by editing the XML, note the following basic points.

* Delete any sections you want; make sure XML remains legal
* You can try some standard HTML syntax. Remember though:

	* all tags must be closed.
	* not all HTML is implemented.
	* all text and HTML belongs inside the ``<text>`` tags

* The ``<expression>`` tag contains the question's correct answer

* All variables in ``<expression>`` must receive numerical assignments
  in the ``<global>`` tag

* All question keys must be unique in the exercise

* All choices keys must be unique in the multiple choice question.

* ``Vi``  mode is enabled if you choose ``Switch keymap default``.

* The ``<right>`` tag is used to right justify a figure on the page.
  Delete the entire line if you are not going to use a figure.

* Mathematical expressions are interpreted through `KaTeX
  <https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/>`_, which is a subset of `LaTeX
  <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_.


Save the exercise
=================

.. note::

   * You will not be able to save if there are errors in the XML

* Press ``Save`` when there are no errors

.. note::

   * In case you make a mess of the XML and can't recover:

	* Press the |fa-undo| button (reset), it is the blue button
          next to the ``Save`` button in the editing box

	* Start over completely and reload the question

	* If the XML is really messed up , try ``XML & assets``
          instead of ``Live Edit``


Publish the exercise

* Press ``Options`` in the toolbar, which is next to ``LiveEdit`` in the blue toolbar.

* Click on the ``Published`` checkbox to enable it
