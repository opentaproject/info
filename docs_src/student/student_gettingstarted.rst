Problems with LTI access: 
------------
* Multiple OpenTA identities or a hash as username ?  
		-  This has happened for GU students taking Chalmers courses. 
		- Make sure you are logged in only through the Chalmers Canvas.
* Access denied  : `Please enable cookies (and third-party cookies) to access OpenTA`
		- Canvas sets third party cookies to open an app in a frame.
		- Enable third party cookies in your browser 
		- If you don't want to allow all third party cookies, allow those from ``[*.]instructure.com``
* Update your browswer; OpenTA enforces security settings that are violated in earlier browswers.
* If you still get problems with LTI access write an email
